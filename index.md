## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

Lab 04 Parts 1 & 2
What I enjoyed about this lab was the use of nested for-loops and if-statements within for-loops. It was a somewhat dubious at first sight but as my teamate and I were working on it, I started to understand when for-loops are appropriate to use.

Lab 07 Parts 1 & 2
I think lab 07 was my favorite lab of them all. I was a little comfortable with the material at the moment. It was really fun using logical operators for time and day to determine when parking is allowed.

Lab 10 Part 1
To be honest I liked this lab because it was short and simple to understand. I also got the chance to be the one helping my teamate understand the instructions and as well as the code I was typing down.
